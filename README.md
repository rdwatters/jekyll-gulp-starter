## Jekyll Starter Kit with Gulp Asset Pipeline

### Requirements

1. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

> If you have not installed any of the above already and are new to the command line, I would recommend installing Node/NPM and Git via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Jekyll's official site includes [decent instructions for ins]

### Getting Started

1. `cd whatever/directory/you/want/to/work/from`
2. `git clone https://github.com/rdwatters/jekyll-gulp-starter`
3. `cd jekyll-gulp-starter/gulp`
4. `npm install && gulp`
5. If your default browser doesn't open automatically, navigate to `localhost:3000`. You should see "Jekyll Starter with Gulp Asset Pipeline." Enjoy the [BrowserSync magic](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/gulp/).

### Notes

This is a port of a [Hugo Starter Kit](https://github.com/rdwatters/hugo-starter) I'm developing but with a different feature set. Unlike Hugo, Jekyll does not come with a LiveReload option as part of its local server.
